## Description

A social media startup. 

Social-Media-Api is an application that allows for creating users, adding friends, posting and editing thoughts, and adding and deleting reactions to those thoughts. This is back end app which has an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database - MongoDB.

So website that will be connected to app could handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Installation

Links to the repository and the deployed page can be found at [Questions](#questions).

While this project's repository is available on Github, there is no front end, and thus it is not deployed. If you clone the repo you must run the command "npm install" on the Terminal/Command Line and download the dependencies.
